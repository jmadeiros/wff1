        <p className="text-base mb-4 text-white/90">
          The Women's Faith Forum is a group of six women from each of the major faiths who have been working together
          for three years to ensure the voices of women are better heard amongst policy makers. We are uniquely placed
          as mothers, daughters, carers, community builders and facilitators to come together, regardless of our
          political affiliations. Our aim is to work together for a better country for all, even as the world around us
          is in crisis.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base mb-4 text-white/90">
          The Women's Faith Forum does not focus on the differences between our faiths but instead on the common ground
          of faith and gender that we share and the roles we play in our communities. Our events aim to be inclusive and
          collaborative whilst modelling empathetic and compassionate behaviours.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base text-white/90">
          Many societal challenges and harms particularly affect women, the solutions to them are often to be found
          through the work of the women and the people who are least heard are the women. This is amplified in the faith
          communities. We want more women's voices round the table and a greater focus on supporting communities.
