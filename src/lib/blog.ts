    <h2>Statement from the Women's Faith Forum</h2>
    <p>Violence against women is a human rights violation and knows no national, cultural or faith barriers. The International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women launched sixteen days of activism ending on Friday, December 10th, International Human Rights Day. It was established by the United Nations to fight against "any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, or mental harm or suffering to women".</p>
    
    <p>Women of faith are sometimes even doubly persecuted, firstly for being women and secondly, and possibly even more disturbingly, within the traditions and practices of their own faith groups.</p>
    
    <p>As six women, each from one of the world's major faith communities, we reject all violence against women within the context of human rights. Moreover, we believe that our faith traditions, at their core, specifically preclude the violation of human rights for women.</p>
    
    <h2>Faith Traditions on Women's Dignity and Rights</h2>
    
    <h3>Sikhism</h3>
    <p>We are reminded that Sikh Gurus raised their voice against injustice and violence towards women in medieval India, and instead championed the centrality of women in society and the need to respect and value them:</p>
    
    <p class="italic">"From woman, man is born; within woman, man is conceived; to woman he is engaged and married. Woman becomes his friend; through woman, the future generations come. When his woman dies, he seeks another woman; to woman he is bound. So why call her bad? From her, kings are born. From woman, woman is born; without woman, there would be no one at all." (Guru Granth Sahib Ang 473)</p>
    
    <h3>Judaism</h3>
    <p>In the Hebrew Bible, Genesis tells the story of the very beginning of humankind. Women and Men, it asserts were made equal in the sight of God, each created in God's image.</p>
    
    <p class="italic">"So God created the human beings in the (divine} image, creating (them) in the image of God, creating them Male and Female" (Genesis 1:26-28)</p>
    
    <p>The Jewish husband's traditional obligations to his wife were extensive, including her right to food, clothing, and sexual relations, medical expenses when ill, ransom if taken captive, burial, and the right to maintenance and to remain on his property as a widow.</p>
    
    <h3>Christianity</h3>
    <p>In the New Testament, the basis of Christianity, the Apostle Paul wrote to the Church in Colossae (3:19) with advice specifically to men about how to treat and revere their wives:</p>
    
    <p class="italic">"Husbands, love your wives [with an affectionate, sympathetic, selfless love that always seeks the best for them] and do not be embittered or resentful toward them [because of the responsibilities of marriage]."</p>
    
    <h3>Islam</h3>
    <p>The Qur'an too, states that the relationship between man and wife is based on tranquility, unconditional love, tenderness, protection, encouragement, peace, kindness, comfort, justice and mercy.</p>
    
    <p class="italic">"O mankind we have created you from a single male and female and have made you into nations and tribes so that you might come to know one another" (Al Hujurat 49:13).</p>
    
    <h3>Hinduism</h3>
    <p>The partnership between men and women and their interdependence, is reflected in Hindu scripts:</p>
    
    <p class="italic">"In other words, the wife must remain embraced by her husband. Thus she becomes beloved and well protected. Just as one saves his money and places it under his own personal protection, one should similarly protect his wife". (Srimad Bhagavatam 4.26.17)</p>
    
    <p>And in Islam: <span class="italic">"They (wives) are garments for you while you are garments for them". (Quran 2:187)</span></p>
    
    <h2>Our Call to Action</h2>
    <p>We, as Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Sikh and Jewish women believe that our faith teachings give us a moral and also a religious responsibility, based on ancient scriptures, to stand up against all forms of violence specifically those against women. We recognise, however, that although our respective faith groups, at their core, preach messages of women's equality and human rights for all, tragically these commandments have not always translated into practice. This remains true today, often leading to the misinterpretation or selective reading of scriptures and the ongoing subjugation of women, even in the modern, democratic world.</p>
    
    <p>On this International Human Rights Day in particular, we call upon governments, faith leaders, community activists, families and individuals, to advocate for an end to violence against women and also against all humanity, irrespective of sex, gender or belief. We are each, after all, God's beloved creation.</p>
    
    <p class="italic">"Let all abide in peace" (Guru Granth Sahib Ang 74)</p>
    
    <h2>About the Women's Faith Forum</h2>
    <p>The Women's Faith Forum is a collection of high-profile women from across the major faith groups who inform policy, faith leadership and community leaders, at all levels of political and civic society.</p>
    
    <p>Motivated by our faith traditions we are inspired to live, work and to be known as women of faith. Between us from Islam, Sikhism, Hinduism, Christianity and Judaism we bring our different theologies, traditions, cultural norms, worship practices, ways of living and serving in our communities. There is much in common that we share yet our diversity provides opportunities to learn, particularly about the vital roles that women play both in our own faith communities and, on their behalf, in wider society. As women leaders in our faith groups, we have the opportunity to listen into thousands of families and community conversations. Through our networks we have ready access to the views and experiences of countless women, and men.</p>
    
    <p>The Women's Faith Forum will enable the voices of women throughout the UK - their hopes, fears, beliefs and ambitions to shape positive societal change â€“ to be heard. We can ensure that the experiences, skills and dedication of women both in faith communities and beyond are focused on the key issues of today, including the pandemic and its impact.</p>
    
    <p>To this end, the Forum is inviting policy makers, influencers and civil society organisations to engage with us, to listen and to embrace authentic inclusivity.</p>

      "Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper has said that women's interfaith work was now 'more important than ever'.

    <h2>Shadow Home Secretary Addresses Inaugural Parliamentary Event</h2>
    <p>Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper has said that women's interfaith work was now "more important than ever".</p>
    
    <p>Addressing the inaugural parliamentary Women's Faith Forum event, the MP said: "Being here and being together is so important at a time when antisemitism is at a record high, and Islamophobia has trebled [since October 7].</p>
    
    <p>"Because of the trauma [of events in the Middle East], interfaith bridges are feeling fractured at the moment, so your work is more important than ever."</p>
    
    <p>The MP for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford said that she was often reminded of the words of the late Jo Cox, the Labour MP, who was murdered by a far-right terrorist in 2016. "Jo was a neighbour and a friend. She would say: 'We have more in common than that which divides us.' Sometimes, the work is harder than at other times, such as now, but we know that it's possible."</p>
    
    <h2>Rising Concerns About Faith-Based Hate Crime</h2>
    
    <p>Also speaking on the issue of gendered antisemitism and Islamophobia was Amanda Bowman, who chairs the defence and group relations division at the Board of Deputies and is standing to be the next president.</p>
    
    <p>Calling out the lack of condemnation by feminist groups over the sexual violence of October 7, Bowman said: "It took UN Women five months [to publish a report] and any mention of the atrocities until then was met with denial, disbelief or that the women deserved it."</p>
    
    <p>She told the audience how she was waiting at a bus-stop recently, without wearing any visibly Jewish clothing or accessories, and someone walked past her and said: "'Dirty Jew'".</p>
    
    <p>Bowman added: "Before October 7, there was an average of five antisemitic incidents per month. There is now an average of 31 per day."</p>
    
    <p>According to a JPR report, 69 per cent of Jewish women felt that antisemitism was a problem, but that women were less inclined to report it than men, said Bowman.</p>
    
    <p>A similar picture could be seen in the Muslim community, said, Julie Siddiqi, co-founder of the Nisa-Nashim Jewish and Muslim Women's Network, who said: "Statistics tell us that more than two-thirds of Islamophobic attacks are against women, but the reality is that most people don't report things."</p>
    
    <p>Siddiqi said that according to Tell Mama, which records anti-Muslim attacks, the abuse included vandalism of property, online abuse and physical attacks.</p>
    
    <p>"Headscarves have been ripped off women on the Underground," she said.</p>
    
    <p>Siddiqi, a former chair of her local standing advisory council for religious education, said that in the 25 years of working in interfaith relations, she had "never seen something happen in another place impacting people the way it is at the moment. There is fear and anger among Jewish and Muslim women and a hierarchy of victimhood. It's a real shame."</p>
    
    <p>Speaking afterwards to the JC, Siddiqi said that the conflict had "been brutal" for interfaith work, but that "we have to continue to have hope.</p>
    
    <p>"We can't allow the politics of it all to get in the way of friendship. I know my Jewish friends are going through a lot. For me, what really matters is the personal side of it."</p>
    
    <h2>The Role of Women in Faith Communities</h2>
    
    <p>Organiser Laura Marks, a co-founder of the Women's Faith Forum and of Nisa-Nashim, said: "Women of faith communities are embedded in faith communities like no one else â€“ in the preparation of food, the places of worship and combating poverty. Women are at the coalface."</p>
    
    <p>The aim of Women's Faith Forum, said Marks, was "to ensure the voices of women are better heard amongst policy makers. We are uniquely placed to come together, regardless of our political affiliations or religions, to work for a better Britain for all, even as the world around us is in crisis".</p>
    
    <p>Labour MP Marsha de Cordova, who hosted the meeting, told the group that while "division is seeping across society, women of faith have a role to play in alleviating that. They can drive peace and solidarity in our communities. When global conflicts are worrying many people, that solidarity is needed more than ever."</p>

    excerpt:

    <h2>1 Introduction to Interfaith Week</h2>
    <p>In all corners of the UK, the country's diverse and vibrant faith communities play a critical role in
    national life. MPs will be acutely aware of the huge contributions to society that faith and interfaith
    groups make on a daily basis â€“ from the smallest parish halls to the largest gurdwaras, bustling city
    mosques, to every denomination of synagogue or church.</p>
    <p>Interfaith Week (IFW) was established by the Inter Faith Network, disbanded by the last
    government, but the week itself has been reprieved, through an interim structure, whilst a new way
    forward is under review. The aim is to celebrate the diverse and contributory range of faith
    communities individually and as a collective. Like all Days or Weeks, these are the tip of the iceberg
    â€“ the work goes on week by week, month by month.</p>

    <h2>2 Challenges to attending events in Interfaith week</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Women and young people</h3>
    <p>Whilst a laudable aim, sometimes opportunities for genuine connection and conversation with those
    who belong to faith groups can feel challenging, even when Parliamentarians are aware of
    communities located in their local area. This is particularly true of interactions with women and
    younger people, whose vital roles in religious settings are all too often minimised and overlooked.</p>
    <h3>2.2 The political climate</h3>
    <p>Similarly, the current political climate can overshadow IFW with the focus solely on the impact of
    international conflict, the extraordinary rise in faith based hate crime (particularly against Jews and
    Muslims), the summer riots, immigration, and the harms done by the fringes of our communities.
    Many challenges facing the faith communities revolve around racism, poverty, politics and exclusion,
    making it even more important this week to focus on celebrating the enormous and diverse
    contribution of the faith communities to our nation.</p>
    <h3>2.3 The demand for funding and resources</h3>
    <p>Not a new topic but an ongoing challenge for faith-based charities and initiatives, particularly those
    in the community space rather than the harder edged areas around hate crime and extremism.
    Boroughs vary in how seriously they take the topic locally and how they structure support â€“ but
    inevitably it is not enough.</p>
    <h3>2.4 The hierarchy of victimhood</h3>
    <p>Also well established in the faith communities is the belief in all faith communities that they are the
    least heard, least supported and most needy. In different ways each have a point but it makes
    interaction between MPs and faith communities competitive, difficult and often uncollaborative.
    Not easy to navigate, this well-known but never mentioned phenomenon exists and is unhelpful for
    all the faith communities in the UK.</p>

    <h2>3. Top tips for better interactions with faith groups in your area:</h2>
    <p>Every constituency is different and unique and you know it best, but the following tips have been
    designed by members of the Women's Faith Forum to help all MPs experience meaningful and
    inclusive interactions with faith groups in their areas, to deepen understanding, and to help improve
    dialogue between faith groups.</p>
    <p><strong>Ask specifically to meet with women and youth in faith communities</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>All too often, visits to a local place of worship will revolve around a select group of male
      representatives (religious leaders, elders, congregants and others of influence).</li>
      <li>Indicating before you go that you are keen to also hear specifically from women at a meeting or
      event may help ensure that you get to meet a variety of people and hear more perspectives as part
      of a visit.</li>
      <li>The community may offer to let you see a Youth or Women's Project... but at least that will give
      you access to talk to these groups.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Seek out activities that bring different faith groups together â€“ well!</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Whilst IFW isn't 'just' about interfaith activities, these are essential and extremely difficult to set up
      in a meaningful and sensitive way. Anyone who says this is easy is ignoring the reality on the
      ground.</li>
      <li>For your own comfort, establish if this is a new/one off initiative, who is hosting it, and if it is joint
      or single faith led, what diversity is built in (especially women) and what is on the agenda; ie is this
      for show or is it for real. There are many different models â€“ but knowing the intentions really helps.</li>
      <li>Your presence might enable more people to feel confident to attend.... But it may also do the
      opposite.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Look beyond the largest, established organisations</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The big organisations in the faith space get face-time with ministers, MPs, and other influencers
      year round, but please be aware that the faith community scene is granular.</li>
      <li>Whether it is a church with just a few elderly congregants holding a prayer meeting, a sensitive
      interfaith gathering, some young people running a football group, or a group of women cooking for a
      night shelter, these events are often small and quiet.</li>
      <li>They are real and the core of the work whether or not they are labelled as IFW.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Offer to convene an event or meeting of your own</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>A request to meet with local faith groups or an invitation for multiple groups to meet with you
      might be well received.</li>
      <li>To avoid many of the four challenges above sabotaging your work, maybe hold a round table on a
      topic of shared interest to all the local faith communities... food poverty locally, climate change
      initiatives, sport provision etc will be more productive than a general discussion.</li>
      <li>Alternatively, set up an event where you are doing something rather than talking eg a tree
      planting, a multifaith peace walk, a social action event.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Case Studies</h2>
    <h3>4.1 Leicester Stories of Hope</h3>
    <p>Set up in response to community tensions arising from
    the events of August 2022, which resulted in suspicion, fear and mistrust between some
    Hindus and Muslims in Leicester.</p>
    <p>LSOH offers a safe space for Hindu and Muslim women to restore solidarity and also
    build resilience to any future difficulties that may arise in the future.</p>
    <p>Following their work, the LSOH were asked to present at an All-Party Parliamentary
    Group (APPG) in Parliament on social cohesionâ€”Lessons from Leicester. Currently
    assisting the University of Leicester for their research on developing a Peace Project.</p>
    <p><em>Photo: Baroness Maeve Sherlock visit as Shadow Minister for Faith.</em></p>
    
    <h3>4.2 Mitzvah Day (November 24th 2024)</h3>
    <p>An international day of Jewish led social action, Mitzvah
    Day is the annual day when the Jewish community reaches out, hands on, locally, to support
    charities and to build local relationships with other faith communities.</p>
    <p>Mitzvah Day builds on the work faith communities already do locally
    supporting food banks, environmental projects, care homes etc in a joyful
    day of hands on activity. It celebrates volunteerism and the ongoing work of
    the faith communities.</p>
    <p>Positively Jewish but outward facing, the lack of a political agenda (MD does
    not engage in The Conflict) means that MPs of all parties have supported
    MD over many years including cabinet ministers, PMs and Party leaders.</p>
    <p><em>Photo: Theresa Villiers at local a local Mitzvah Day in her constituency.</em></p>
    
    <h3>4.3 Oasis Community Learning</h3>
    <p>St Martin-in-the-Fields High School was opened in 1699 to provide
    education specifically for girls â€“ a revolution at the time. The school closed this year and the site, in
    Brixton, south London, has become a project of Oasis, a fully inclusive Christian organisation.</p>
    <p>Now known as Oasis St Martin's Village, the challenge is to do a similarly bold thing within a
    21st century context. Absenteeism, exclusions, special educational needs and mental health are
    pressing issues with few answers. The mission is to tackle these issues with a special, though not
    exclusive, focus on girls, working with local community charities and faith organisations. One of our
    most recently established projects is a safe space for Muslim girls' football.</p>
    
    <h3>4.4 Women's Faith Forum</h3>
    <p>Established in 2020, a group of six
    women each deeply embedded at a senior level, within their own
    communities. In addition, each woman is engaged with policy
    makers, across the political spectrum on a wide variety of issues.</p>
    <p>Our most recent event was held in October 2024 hosted by Sarah
    Sackman MP and addressed by MPs from across the faith spectrum
    on Hate Crime attended by women practitioners from across civil
    society. This format enabled a dialogue on this topic which
    particularly affects women both as victims and as problem solvers.</p>
