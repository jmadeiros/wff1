    <h2>Event Overview</h2>
    <p>The publication of new hate crime figures from the Home Office was the background for an event in parliament on 15th October, hosted by the Women's Faith Forum as part of National Hate Crime Awareness Week.</p>
    
    <p>Whilst hate crime overall had declined slightly this year, the figures showed the highest annual count in religious hate crime offences since the department began collecting data in 2012, driven by anti-Jewish and anti-Muslim hate crime.</p>
    
    <h2>Distinguished Attendees</h2>
    <p>Hosted by Sarah Sackman KC MP, Solicitor General, and attended by Lord Khan, Minister for Faith, the event in parliament was attended by over 50 women of faith from civil society organisations and joined by 6 parliamentarians. It provided an opportunity to share lived experiences, initiatives, and the demands of civil society around faith-based hate crime.</p>
    
    <p>Ms Sackman told the meeting of the Women's Faith Forum that raising awareness of hate crime and the presence of the meeting in itself was an act of hope. Ms Sackman's call to the meeting was that the Britain represented in the forum should be the Britain we should want to be part of. She said, "I was inspired to join the incredible Women's Faith Forum & help set out this government's agenda for tackling Hate Crime. From education to law enforcement, you have a commitment from us to address the rise we've seen in religiously motivated attacks."</p>
    
    <h2>Parliamentary Support</h2>
    <p>The event was attended by parliamentarians from Jewish, Christian, Sikh and Muslim traditions and, additionally featured speakers from all faiths and none.</p>
    
    <p>Christine Jardine MP Lib Dem (Edinburgh West) and Spokesperson for Women and Equalities said that we are standing at a very difficult point in history with the explosion of Islamophobia and antisemitism. She urged the women to talk openly about it and to act in their communities. She also said the police need to be trusted to respond swiftly and that MPs must play their role by watching their words and setting a constructive tone for public debate.</p>
    
    <p>Laura Marks, co-founder of the Women's Faith Forum said, "The women of Britain are particularly vulnerable to hate crime and equally, hold the key to understanding ways to address it. The Women's Faith Forum allows the often unheard but highly effective voices of the women of the faith communities, to be heard by policy makers and to change the national narrative."</p>
    
    <h2>Community Voices</h2>
    <p>Kirith Entwistle MP, Labour (Bolton North East) encouraged members to keep putting themselves forward and to be proud of their faith identity. She urged the attendees to ensure that the fire of hate crime is not allowed to be ignited.</p>
    
    <p>Anna Dixon MP Labour (Shipley) spoke about Bradford's long and well-established history as a city of sanctuary following the race riots in 2001 and the formation of the Bradford Hate Crime Alliance.</p>
    
    <p>Other MPs attending and speaking were Preet Kaur Gill MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, who spoke movingly about her own experiences of hate crime, and Satvir Kaur MP for Southampton.</p>
    
    <p>Hadiya Masieh, Founder and Executive Director of The Groundswell Project, said: "As we map hatred, we must also map kindness. In the darkness of hate crime haters divide – we must unify. We must promote kindness at all costs."</p>
    
    <p>Rev'd Lucy Winkett, Priest, St James Piccadilly reflected on how this year marks the 30th year of the anniversary of the ordination of women in the CofE when there had been an explosion of hate against women and the role of women in leadership. She had felt vulnerable going out into the street with her collar on but she encouraged women in religious circles to keep on moving from the private to the public – to lead, to teach, to be visible – to promote compassion and inclusion. "We cannot leave the interpretation of our scriptures to others."</p>

    <h2>The Women's Faith Forum Inaugural Event</h2>
    <p>In response to the alarming rise of Islamophobia and antisemitism in the UK, the Women's Faith Forum held its inaugural event at the Houses of Parliament on February 28, 2024. The event brought together women from diverse faith backgrounds to share experiences, possible solutions, and practical ways women of faith can help heal divisions and work together to combat hate.</p>
    
    <h2>Distinguished Hosts and Speakers</h2>
    <p>The event was hosted by the MP for Battersea, Marsha de Cordova, and featured Yvette Cooper, who served as Shadow Home Secretary, as one of the main speakers. Cooper called for cooperation across party lines while also emphasizing the role of government in building community and challenging hate crime.</p>
    
    <p>Cooper, like many others at the event, expressed concern about the recent decision by the government to withdraw funding for the Inter Faith Network, viewing it as a misstep at a time when building relationships across faith communities was more important than ever.</p>
    
    <h2>Diverse Representation</h2>
    <p>The event included prominent women from religious, cultural, and political organisations from around the country. This diverse representation allowed for a rich exchange of perspectives and experiences related to faith-based discrimination and community building.</p>
    
    <h2>Focus on Women's Experiences</h2>
    <p>The Women's Faith Forum recognises that harm or violence against faith communities tends to affect women disproportionately, so it is working to enable the voices of women throughout the UK—their hopes, fears, beliefs, and ambitions—to shape positive societal change.</p>
    
    <p>Cooper confirmed this assessment during the event, stating, "Whether abuse or threats, very often they are targeted at women. For us to come together to talk about this, felt immensely important."</p>
    
    <h2>Outcomes and Next Steps</h2>
    <p>This inaugural event established the Women's Faith Forum as a significant platform for interfaith dialogue and action against religious hatred. The connections formed and insights shared during this gathering have laid the groundwork for ongoing collaboration among women of faith across the UK.</p>
    
    <p>Following this successful launch, the Women's Faith Forum has continued to organize events and initiatives focused on combating hate crime and building stronger, more resilient interfaith communities.</p>
